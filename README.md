# Bounding-Box-Patch-Calculator
 Patches the Bounding Boxes for models Imported with DSFBX using the BB solver from [FBX2FLVER](https://github.com/Meowmaritus/FBX2FLVER) by [Meowmaritus](https://gist.github.com/Meowmaritus) (Or any parts files that need new bounding boxes)

## Current know compatability: 
* Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition  
* Elden Ring?  
* In theory this should work for every game  

### Instructions  

1) Make a folder with all the partsbnds and/or flvers you want to patch.  

2) Drop Bounding Box Patch Calculator.exe into the folder and run it.  

3) Optionally you can drag and drop a file onto the exe, as well!  

### Thank you

**[Meowmaritus](https://github.com/Meowmaritus)** for the awesome tools he makes. If it weren't for his work, this tool would likely not be possible.  
**[Pear](https://github.com/Meowmaritus)** figured out what I was doing wrong. :fatcat:  
**[Dropoff](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/57663811)** helped me figure out how to patch dynamic meshes
